    <!-- Research Basis -->
    <string name="research_basis">Research Basis</string>
    <string name="military_research_basis">Research shows a strong relationship between UFO sightings and proximity to military installations, with studies finding that 61% of all UFO sightings occur within 24 miles of a military installation, and 82% within 42 miles.</string>
    <string name="astronomical_research_basis">Many studies indicate that astronomical phenomena are often misidentified as UFOs. Analysis shows strong correlations between meteor shower peaks and \'fireball\' UFO reports, as well as between satellite passes and \'formation\' sightings.</string>
    <string name="weather_research_basis">Research has shown correlations between unusual weather conditions (particularly thunderstorms, temperature inversions, and fog) and reported UFO sightings. These conditions can create optical illusions and unusual light refraction.</string>
    <string name="population_research_basis">Studies have found a sub-linear relationship between population density and UFO sightings, indicating that while more people means more potential observers, the relationship is not directly proportional.</string>

    <string name="weather_correlation_method">Method: Spatiotemporal correlation between weather events and UFO sightings within 50km and 24 hours.</string>
    <string name="population_method">Method: Sightings normalized by population density to identify deviations from expected distribution.</string>
